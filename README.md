Big Data with example and types:

Big data is an information asset characterized by high volume, velocity, and variety. It refers to large datasets that are difficult to process using traditional methods due to their size and complexity. 

Examples for Big data are

Enterprises:
Million dollar enterprises like Amazon, Google, Microsoft are generating the vast amount of information from the users.

Transportation:
Assist in GPS navigation, traffic and weather alerts.

Social Media Platforms:
Social media apps like Instagram, Tiktok, Facebook, Whatapp has millions of users downloads. These apps are collecting millions of users information and performing operations on it.

Financial data:
Everything is digitalised recently including the transactions. Each day millions of transactions happening in the world which produce vast amount of data.


Types of big data:

Structured data: Structured data is organized which has a label and can be easily processed by machines.

Unstructured data: Unstructured data is not organized which doesnot have any label and is often difficult to process.

Semi-structured data: Semi-structured data is mixture of both structure and unstructured elements. 

Streaming data: Streaming data is generated in real-time and includes data from IoT devices, social media platforms, and other sources. This type of data requires real-time processing to extract insights and make decisions.

The 6 'V's of Big Data refer to the characteristics of big data which include volume, velocity, variety, veracity, value, and variability.
Volume:
The amount of data is referred as volume. Measured in terms of petabytes, terabytes, and exabytes.
Velocity:
The speed at which data can be produced. It is processed to extract the meaningful insight.
Variety:
Type of data can be structured, unstructured and semi structured.
Veracity:
In few instances data can be unreliable or incomplete, and it can be difficult to determine the accuracy and reliability of the data. Veracity refers to the quality of the data can be trused or not.
value:
From big data valuble information can be extracted which can be used improvised the business profits
Variability:
Big data is not always static, it changes which time. It refers to the dynamic ways data can be formated

Big data analysis involves several steps to extract the information from complex data sets. Following are steps involved
a. Data Acquisition and Recording:
First involves collection of data. Data is generated from different sources so by using some filtration methods need to collect data which is useful.   
b. Information Extraction and Cleaning:
Once iformation is collected need to apply few methods like filling the null values, removing outliers and correct inconsistent data.
c. Data Integration, Aggregation, and Representation:
After cleaning the data, reduce the redundacies and apply visualizations methods to display the data.
d. Query Processing, Data Modeling, and Analysis:
Data is present in various ways so diffrent data analysis methods are used.
e. Interpretation: 
visualization helps to understand the data better, so understand and verify the results.

Challenges of Big Data:

Storage:
If there is vast amount of data then it is quite difficult to maintain and manage it. Unstructured data cannot be stored in traditional databases.

Processing:
Processing big data refers to the reading, transforming, extraction of important information. The input and output large information present delay in processing time.

Security:
Security is a big concern for organizations. Non-encrypted information is at risk so data security professionals should follow strict security protocols.

Data Validation:
Before using data in a business process, its integrity, accuracy, and structure must be validated. The output of a data validation procedure can be used for further analysis, BI, or even to train a machine learning model.

Healthcare Challenges:
Electronic health records (EHRs), genomic sequencing, medical research, wearables, and medical imaging are just a few examples which produce huge amount health-related big data.
